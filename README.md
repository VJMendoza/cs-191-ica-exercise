# cs-191-ica-exercise
This is an exercise using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for CS 191(ML) 2nd Semester SY 2018-2019. It contains two folders, `Image ICA` and `Audio ICA`, both of which show the use of ICA in image and audio separation respectively.

## Image ICA
This folder contains the script containing the implementation for image separation. It also contains the images used as well as the paper for it.

To run the script, 
1. Open a terminal in the directory of the folder.
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python image_ica.py`.

The resulting separated images are saved in [`images\res`](Image ICA/images/res)

## Audio ICA
